        <h2>My Early Life</h2>
        <p>I was born in The Hague, The Netherlands. I spent my early years moving back and forth
            between the Netherlands and Oregon, USA, where I ended up spending the rest of my childhood
            just outside of Portland. I spent my high school years competing on the swim and pole 
            vaulting teams, creating and running our schools woodworking club, volunteering for the school
            and outside programs, and as a student in the International Bacceultate program.

        <h2>My Life at University</h2>
        <p>After I graduated high school, I moved to Corvallis Oregon to attend Oregon State University.
            In my freshman year, I studied the general engineering program mostly interested in mechanical and
            aerospace engineering (planes, after all, are pretty crazy). After completing three terms, I decided 
            to take a break from school. I spent a year abroad (more information below) but decided in the Spring
            to return to school to study web development. This was briefly lived and after meeting people in the
            security field, I decied to enter my junior as a cybersercurity major. I now have just over a year left
            of school before I enter the work field.
